### Welcome on my profile

Here you will find my hobby projects. They are all experiments on specific topics, may they be mathematical, technical or artistic. I use them as exercices for me to learn and practice technologies such as WebGL, WebGPU or Typescript. My interests revolve around mathematics, GPU computing and generative art. My goal is mostly to create beautiful little things.

You can find a live portfolio of my GitHub projects here: [piellardj.github.io](https://piellardj.github.io).

You can reach me by email: [jeremie.piellard@gmail.com](mailto:jeremie.piellard@gmail.com). I am always happy to answer messages ðŸ™‚.
